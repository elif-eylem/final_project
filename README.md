The create_graph notebook includes code to perform perform the claim verification. 

This notebooks is desgined to be called from the two ther notebooks for each dataset. 

To run the code on the averitec dataset and scifact datasets, one simpply runs the respective notebooks.  

Code runs extremely slowly due to its heavy reliance of APIs. 

Evaluation is perfomed in the final_eval notebook. 

Performance on Averitec dataset is futher evaluated  using code provided by the aviertec challenge.
